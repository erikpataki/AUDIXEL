    <p>Welcome to AUDIXEL, an innovative and exciting application designed to transform your favourite music into stunning visual art! Whether you're a music producer looking to create unique album art or a music lover who enjoys exploring creative tools, AUDIXEL offers a fun and engaging way to visualise your music in a whole new light.</p>
    
    <h2>What does AUDIXEL do?</h2>
    <p>AUDIXEL takes your songs and processes them to create beautiful, abstract images. Here's a simple breakdown of how the process works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Upload your music:</strong> Start by selecting a music file (.wav, .mp3, or .ogg) from your computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Music analysis:</strong> AUDIXEL will analyse various features of the music, such as its energy, pitch, and rhythm.</li>
      <li><strong>Image generation:</strong> Based on the music analysis, AUDIXEL generates an abstract image. The visual elements of the image are influenced by the music's features. For example, a high-energy song might produce vibrant, dynamic visuals, while a calm, soothing track might result in more subdued, relaxed pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Customisation:</strong> You can tweak various settings to customise the generated image. Adjust the amount of pixel sorting, change the angle of the visual elements, and select different sorting modes (like brightness, hue, or saturation) to get the perfect look.</li>
      <li><strong>Download and share:</strong> Once you're happy with the generated image, you can download it and share it with your friends, use it as album art, or simply enjoy it as a piece of digital art.</li>
    </ol>
